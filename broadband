<p><b>MEASURING BROADBAND AMERICA</b> represents an ongoing nationwide performance study of residential wireline broadband service in the United States.  The Measuring Broadband America program developed out of a recommendation by the National Broadband Plan (NBP) to improve the availability of information for consumers about their broadband service.</p>

<p>The initial Measuring Broadband America Report, released in August 2011, presented the first broad-scale study of actual home broadband performance throughout the United States.  The study examined service offerings from 13 of the largest wireline broadband providers using automated, direct measurements of broadband performance delivered to the homes of thousands of volunteers during March 2011.</p>

<p>The February 2013 Measuring Broadband America Report contains the most recent results from the Federal Communication Commission's Measuring Broadband America program, based on test measurements taken in August 2012. The Report highlights the major findings of the study, while the separate Technical Appendix provides a detailed description of the methodology and describes the specific tests that were performed.</p>

<p>The July 2012 Measuring Broadband America Report contains the results based on test measurements taken in April 2012.</p>

<p>Related data sets and charts for the 2012 and 2013 reports are also available. Links to data sets and charts can be found in both reports.</p>
